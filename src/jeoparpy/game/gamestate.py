class GameState(Enum):
    """
    The state of a game can be accessed and set from this object. Only one 
    state is allowed at any time. The purpose of a GameState object is to 
    provide a single object to pass around minimal information about the 
    current state of the game to whatever may need it (generally the UI).
    
    State names are passed to __init__, which then become attributes of the 
    class used to check and set the state. For example, if 'STATE1' and 
    'STATE2' are given, an instance of this class, gs, will have gs.STATE1 
    and gs.STATE2 attributes that can be used to check and set the state.
    
    Additional data about the state can be set and accessed with the
    'kwargs' attribute, which is a dictionary. 
    
    IMPORTANT NOTE: 'kwargs' is emptied every time the state is set to 
    prevent unnecessary or outdated data from lingering. The current arguments
    can be re-sent with gs.set(gs.NEW_STATE, **gs.kwargs), but this should
    be done with discretion.
    
    'kwargs' can be set in two ways:
      1) Directly, e.g. gameState.kwargs = {'arg':arg, ...}
      2) As **kwargs to the 'set' method, e.g. with 
         gameState.set(gameState.STATE, arg=value, arg2=value)
    
    EXAMPLE USAGE:
      gs = GameState('STATE1', 'STATE2', 'STATE3')
      
      # Set state
      gs.state = gs.STATE1
      
      # Compare state
      if gs.state == gs.STATE1:
          gs.state = gs.STATE2
          
      # Set kwargs
      gs.state = set(gs.STATE3, extraArg1=1, extraArg2=2)
      
      # Get kwargs
      extraArg1 = gs.state.kwargs['extraArg1']
